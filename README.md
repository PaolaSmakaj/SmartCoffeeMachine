# SmartCoffeeMachine
The coffee machine is activated when the presence of someone nearby is detected. In this mode, the user can adjust the sugar with the Pot and request the coffee using a tactile button. After three times, the coffee machine runs out of coffee material. The system, therefore, waits for the reloading that occurs through a PC-side action. Once the recharge has been completed, the coffee machine can work again.

HW components:
- Arduino
- 3 green LEDs (L1, L2, L3)
- 1 T1 tactile button and 1 Pot potentiometer
- 1 PIR motion sensor and 1 SDist sonar
- Serial connection with PC
